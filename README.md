# Number-Base-Converter
Small tool used to convert a number of any base to another number of any base.

To run this tool, download the files and run the main file in your favorite IDE.

To use this tool:
First enter a base of at least 2.

Then enter the number you want to convert.
  If your number is base 10 or lower, simply enter it normally with no spaces.
  e.g. Binary: 11010101101 ; Octal: 14372

  To enter a number higher than base 10, enter the digits with spaces in between them. 
  Digits higher than 9 in bases higher than 10 will simply be represented in their decimal form.
  This is to facilitate higher bases that go above the letters of the alphabet, as there is no 
  standardized form for these digits.
  e.g. Hexadecimal: 12 13 9 2

  This program also supports negative numbers
  Just remember if you are entering a number with a base greater than 10, treat the negative symbol 
  as a digit and add a space after it.

Then enter the base that you would like to convert to.

The program should immediately spit out your converted number in the form of a list of digits, and stop.
